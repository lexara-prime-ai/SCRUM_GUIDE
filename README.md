# SCRUM
***Definition***: **Agile** is a philosophy that centers around continuous incremental improvement through small and frequent releases ***e.g v1, v1.0.1 and so on***. Scrum is one of the frameworks within Agile methodology for getting work done. 

Other frameworks include: **kanban & xp**.

**NOTE:** Scrum is one type of Agile methodology.

***Definition***: **SCRUM** in full stands for **Systematic Customer Resolution Unravelling Meeting**.

SCRUM is **a way to get work done as a team in small pieces at a time, with experimentation and feedback loops along the way**.

**Methodologies worth mentioning**:
 - Waterfall

## Comparisons

# Scrum and Waterfall are different approaches to software development

   **Scrum** is a *framework*, while **Waterfall** is a *model*.
-   **Scrum** works well for ***complex** and **uncertain projects***, while **Waterfall** works well for ***simple*** and ***predictable projects***.
-   **Scrum** has ***no defined stages***, while **Waterfall** has ***clear and defined stages***.
-   **Scrum** welcomes ***changes at any stage***, while **Waterfall** ***avoids changes after the initial stage***.
-   **Scrum** ***measures production by using velocity and sprints***, while **Waterfall** ***measures production by using phases and milestones.***

## TERMINOLOGY

 1. Scrum **Team** *i.e **Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer***.
 2. Scrum **Events** *i.e **Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective***.
 3. Scrum **Artifacts** *i.e **Product Backlog, Product Goal, Sprint Backlog, Sprint Goal, Increment, Definition of Done***.

**NOTE:** The whole point of SCRUM is to come up with a **Minimum Viable Product** | **Potentially Shippable Product** to showcase to the client.

- The **SCRUM framework** is fairly simple being made up of a **Scrum Team** consisting of a **Product Owner**, a **Scrum Master** and **Developers**, each of which have specific **accountabilities**. The Scrum Team takes part in **five events** and produces **three artifacts**.


# The Scrum Team
- The Scrum Team consists of **one Scrum Master**, **one Product Owner**, and **Developers**. Within a Scrum Team, ***there are no sub-teams or hierarchies***. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.

## What is a Scrum Master ?
 1. A Scrum Master is **accountable for establishing Scrum or implementing the Scrum Framework**. They do this by **helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice**, both within the Scrum Team and the organization while serving the Scrum Team as well as the larger organization.

**1. What does the Scrum Master do?**
 _helps the **Scrum Team**:_
-   By coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality
-   Focus on **creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done**
-   Influence the **removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress**
-   Ensure that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

_helps the **Product Owner**:_

-   Find techniques for effective **Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management**
-   Provide ways for the Scrum Team to understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
-   Establish empirical product planning for a complex environment
-   Facilitate stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed

_supports the **Organization**:_

-   By Leading, training and coaching them in their Scrum adoption
-   By helping employees and stakeholders understand and instill an empirical approach for complex work
-   **Remove barriers** between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

**2. Scrum Master Stances**
- To be successful, the Scrum Master must wear different hats that depend on the situation or challenge the team is facing. These hats are often referred to as stances.

## What is a Product Owner?
A Product Owner is someone who **represents a client or the stakeholders**. A **client will give all the requirements and the Product Owner *will present them to the Team***.

**1. What does the Product Owner do?**
The Product Owner is accountable for effective **Product Backlog management**, which includes:

-   Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
-   Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items
-   Ordering Product Backlog Items
-   Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood


**2. Product Owner Stances**
There are several preferred stances the Product Owner can take in order to achieve their ultimate goal of maximizing value.

## What is a Developer?
**Developers** are the people on the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable **Increment** on each Sprint.

**1. What does the Developer do?**
Developers are always **accountable**  for:

-   **Creating a plan** for the Sprint, the **Sprint Backlog**
-   **Instilling *quality*** by **adhering to a Definition of Done**
-   **Adapting their plan** each day toward the Sprint Goal
-   **Holding each other accountable** as professionals

# The SCRUM Events
These are **Events that create regularity** and ***minimize other meetings***.
Optimally, all events are held at the **same time** and **place** *to reduce complexity*.

The purpose of each is actually quite simple:

-   [**Sprint**](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/sprint "The Sprint")  - All work in Scrum is done in a series of short projects called Sprints. This enables rapid feedback loops.
-   [**Sprint Planning**](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/sprint-planning "Sprint Planning")  - The Sprint starts with a planning session in which the Developers plan the work they intend to do in the Sprint. This plan creates a shared understanding and alignment among the team.
-   [**Daily Scrum**](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/daily-scrum "The Daily Scrum")  - The Developers meet daily to inspect their progress toward the Sprint Goal, discuss any challenges they’ve run into and tweak their plan for the next day as needed.
-   [**Sprint Review**](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/sprint-review "The Sprint Review") - At the end of the Sprint, the Sprint Team meets with stakeholders to show what they have accomplished and get feedback.
-   [**Sprint Retrospective**](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/sprint-retrospective "The Sprint Retrospective")  - Finally, the Scrum Team gets together to discuss how the Sprint went and if there are things they could do differently and improve in the next Sprint.


## 1. What is a Sprint?
They are **fixed length periods** of work that last one month or less to create consistency and ensure **short iterations for feedback** in order to inspect and adapt both how work is done and what is being worked on.

## 2. What is the preferred length of a *Sprint*?
**2 - 4 weeks**(1 month)

## 3. What is Sprint Planning?
**Sprint planning** is an event in Scrum that  **defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved**.

## 4. What is Daily Scrum?
The **Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the [*Developers*]**(https://www.scrum.org/node/8059) of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the [Sprint](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum "What is a Sprint?"). If the [**Product Owner**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner "What is a Product Owner?") or [**Scrum Master**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master "What is a Scrum Master?") are *actively working on items* in the Sprint Backlog, **they participate as Developers**.

## 5. What is a Sprint Review?

The **Sprint Review** is an event for inspecting the outcome of the [Sprint](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-in-scrum "What is a Sprint?") and determine future adaptations.

**The Sprint Review may include the following elements and more:**

-   Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner;
-   Members of the Scrum Team explain what Product Backlog items have been “Done” and what has not been “Done”;
-   The  [Developers](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-developer "What is a Developer in Scrum?") discuss what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved;
-   The Developers demonstrate the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment;
-   The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed);
-   The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent  [Sprint Planning](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-sprint-planning "What is Sprint Planning?");
-   Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next; and,
-   Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated releases of functionality and capability of the product.

## 6. What is a Sprint Retrospective?

A **sprint retrospective** is a meeting that takes place at the end of a sprint, where **the team reflects on what went well and what can be improved**. The purpose is **to inspect and adapt the team's working practices, not the product outcomes**. A sprint retrospective is a part of the Agile framework and the Scrum methodology.

# The SCRUM Artifacts
**Scrum artifacts** are the **documents or objects** that are **used to track the progress and quality of the product development** in Scrum.

**The three key artifacts of Scrum are:**
- **Product backlog:** an ordered list of the features and requirements needed to complete the product
- **Product goal:** a description of a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against
- **Sprint backlog**: a subset of the product backlog that specifies what the team should work on during a 
- **Sprint goal:** Sprint goals are **a set of clear objectives**, defined collaboratively by the product owner and development team **at the start of a sprint**. The goals should be simple, measurable, and indicative of the overall strategic objectives of backlog items.
- **Increment:** the **deliverable product version that is presented to the stakeholder after each sprint**

# Additional info:

## Product Backlog Refinement

**Product Backlog refinement** is the act of breaking down and **further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.** Refinement can occur at any time during a Sprint, in a more formal meeting or meetings, on an ongoing basis or as needed. **Refinement is not mandatory,** however it is a good practice to consider in order to increase transparency and make work items more precise.

#### Commitment: Product Goal

The  [**Product Goal**](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-product-goal "What is a Product Goal?")  describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. **The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog**. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.

> _A product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract._






## What does it mean to have a cross functional development team?
 - In a cross-functional development team members have different skill sets but are all working towards a common goal. It often includes people from different departments and from all levels of the organization

## In case you receive a story in the last day of the sprint to test and you find there are defects, what will you do?
 - Whenever your team finds an incomplete story at the end of the Sprint, simply roll that story, in its entirety, into the next Sprint. 

## What is the role of a tester in Scrum?
 - In Scrum, testers are not only responsible for finding and reporting defects. They are also advocates for quality throughout the product development lifecycle. Testers collaborate with the product owner to define and refine the user stories, acceptance criteria, and definition of done.

## What is the recommended size for a Scrum Team
 - According to the Scrum guide, any Scrum Team should be made up of 10 or fewer people. So, in a small project, you would have a Scrum team of around 5 people – 3 Developers, 1 Product Owner, and 1 Scrum Master. And in a large project, your team would consist of 9 people – 7 Developers, 1 Product Owner, and 1 Scrum Master.
